This quickstart describes the steps to create an Azure Purview account in the Azure portal and get started on the process of classifying, securing, and discovering your data in Purview!

 Important

Azure Purview is currently in PREVIEW. The Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

Azure Purview is a data governance service that helps you manage and govern your data landscape. By connecting to data across your on-premises, multi-cloud, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) sources, Purview creates an up-to-date map of your information. It identifies and classifies sensitive data, and provides end to end linage. Data consumers are able to discover data across your organization, and data administrators are able to audit, secure, and ensure right use of your data.

For more information about Purview, see our overview page. For more information about deploying Purview across your organization, see our deployment best practices.

Prerequisites
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a free subscription before you begin.

An Azure Active Directory tenant associated with your subscription.

The user account that you use to sign in to Azure must be a member of the contributor or owner role, or an administrator of the Azure subscription. To view the permissions that you have in the subscription, go to the Azure portal, select your username in the upper-right corner, select the "..." icon for more options, and then select My permissions. If you have access to multiple subscriptions, select the appropriate subscription.

No Azure Policies preventing creation of Storage accounts or Event Hub namespaces. Purview will deploy a managed Storage account and Event Hub when it is created. If a blocking policy exists and needs to remain in place, please follow our Purview exception tag guide and follow the steps to create an exception for Purview accounts.

Sign in to Azure
Sign in to the Azure portal with your Azure account.

Configure your subscription
If necessary, follow these steps to configure your subscription to enable Azure Purview to run in your subscription:

In the Azure portal, search for and select Subscriptions.

From the list of subscriptions, select the subscription you want to use. Administrative access permission for the subscription is required.

For your subscription, select Resource providers. On the Resource providers pane, search and register all three resource providers:

Microsoft.Purview
Microsoft.Storage
Microsoft.EventHub
If they are not registered, register it by selecting Register.

On the new Create Purview account page, under the Basics tab, select the Azure subscription where you want to create your Purview account.

Select an existing resource group or create a new one to hold your Purview account.

To learn more about resource groups, see our article on using resource groups to manage your Azure resources.

Enter a Purview account name. Spaces and symbols aren't allowed. The name of the Purview account must be globally unique. If you see the following error, change the name of Purview account and try creating again.

Choose a location. The list shows only locations that support Purview. The location you choose will be the region where your Purview account and meta data will be stored. Sources can be housed in other regions.

 Note

Azure Purview does not support moving accounts across regions, so be sure to deploy to the correction region. You can find out more information about this in move operation support for resources.

Select Review & Create, and then select Create. It takes a few minutes to complete the creation. The newly created Azure Purview account instance will appear in the list on your Purview accounts page.
